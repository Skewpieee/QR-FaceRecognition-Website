# QR-FaceRecognition-Website

## Final Year Project (FYP)
**QR-Based Student Attendance System with Face Recognition**  
Universiti Kuala Lumpur (UniKL)

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a web-based student attendance management system that integrates **QR code scanning** and **face recognition** to improve attendance accuracy and prevent proxy attendance. The system is designed to automate attendance recording while ensuring secure and reliable identity verification.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Eliminate proxy attendance in classrooms
- Automate attendance recording using QR codes
- Verify student identity using face recognition
- Store attendance data securely using cloud services

---

## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. Student logs in using UniKL email credentials  
2. Student scans a unique QR code  
3. Face recognition verifies the student’s identity  
4. Attendance is recorded in Firebase Firestore  
5. Admin can view and manage attendance records

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- **Firebase Firestore**
- **FaceAPI.js**
- **QR Code Scanner**
- **GitHub Pages** (for UI deployment)

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations
To protect sensitive information:
- Firebase configuration credentials are **removed** from this public repository
- Placeholder values are used instead
- This follows best practices for public code repositories
